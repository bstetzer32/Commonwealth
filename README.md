## Backend Query to search database conditionally by category, and/or city, and/or state, and/or title

```
            if (category):
        if (state):
            if (city):
                projects = Project.query.filter(
                    Project.title.ilike('%' + inputs + '%')).filter_by(
                        category_id=category.id, state=state,
                        city=city,
                ).all()
                return {
                    'projects': [project.to_dict() for project in projects]
                }

            projects = Project.query.filter(
                Project.title.ilike('%' + inputs + '%')).filter_by(
                    category=category, state=state,
            )
            return {'projects': [project.to_dict() for project in projects]}

        projects = Project.query.filter(
            Project.title.ilike('%' + inputs + '%')).filter_by(
                category=category,
        )
        return {'projects': [project.to_dict() for project in projects]}

    elif (state):
        if(city):
            projects = Project.query.filter(
                Project.title.ilike('%' + inputs + '%')).filter_by(
                    state=state, city=city,
            ).all()
            return {'projects': [project.to_dict() for project in projects]}

```

### Utilizing USPS API to verify address when creating project, and if city isn't in the database, will add it

```
        def create_project():
    form = ProjectForm()
    form['csrf_token'].data = request.cookies['csrf_token']
    location = {
        'address_1': form.data['address_1'],
        'address_2': form.data['address_2'],
        'city': form.data['city'],
        'state': form.data['st'],
        'zipcode': form.data['zipcode']
    }
    validate_address = validate_location(location)
    if 'Error' in validate_address:
        return validate_address
    else:
        form.data['address_1'] = validate_address['Address1']
        form.data['address_2'] = validate_address['Address2']
        form.data['city'] = validate_address['City']
        form.data['zipcode'] = validate_address['Zip5']

    state = State.query.filter_by(name=form.data['st']).first()
    category = Category.query.filter_by(name=form.data['category']).first()
    city = City.query.filter_by(name=form.data['city']).first()

```

## Challenges Faced:

        *
        *

## Future Features:

    * Likes - A user may like a project adding another filterable query based on popularity.

    * Credit Card Payments - Add a validation of payment form and ability to run the info.

    * Account - A user may view their account info and add to a balance.

    * Contact Link - A user will be able to get in communication with a projects creator.
